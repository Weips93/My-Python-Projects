    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are going to analyse [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) posts. Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of our analysis is to identify the types of posts which would generate the most interest as well as when it is best to post on Hacker News to generate the most attention. The data set that we will be using for this analysis is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). Below are the descriptions of the columns:\n",

    "|      URL     |                                 The URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL                                |\n",
    "|  num_points  | The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes |\n",
    "| num_comments |                                   The number of comments that were made on the post                                   |\n",

    "|  created_at  |                                   The date and time (GMT-5) at which the post was submitted                                  |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are specifically interested in the posts which start with \"Ask HN\" or \"Show HN\". Users submit \"Ask HN\" posts to ask Hacker News community a specific question. Users submit \"Show HN\" posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting. The goal of both of these types of posts is to garner attention. Ask HN type posts prompts users to comment on the answer. Show HN posts serves as a type of advertisement for the user. On both occassions it would be useful to know when is the best time to post. We will be using the number of comments on the post as a proxy for the attention for that post.\n",
